# KoalaTs 🐨
Welcome to KoalaTs! KoalaTs is crafted for the laziest backend developers because nothing pairs better with clean APIs than a good nap.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can use the [KoalaTs CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@koala-ts/cli) to generate a new project:

```bash
npx @koala-ts/cli create my-app
```
The above command will generate a new project in the `my-app` directory.

Then, navigate to the project directory and start the server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run start
```
